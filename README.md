# SQL_Challenge
In this challenge I created the tables and uploaded the corresponding csv files. While completing the instructions, I saved 3 separate files; the table schema, the schema for the queries and a combined file for ease of reading. The query schema is commented out steps 1-8 to be taken as per the instructions on the module website.
